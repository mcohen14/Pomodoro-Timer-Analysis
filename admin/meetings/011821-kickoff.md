## Agenda
Create GitHub repository for the team  
Team Contract

## New Business
**GitHub Repository**  
A Github organization was created. The organization name was finalized to be the Team Name. All members have currently been added. A private repository has been made with necessary READMEs and descriptions.

**Team Contract**
An unfinalized Team Contract has been created in the repository. Team contract has rules about what roles each person has during the lifecycle of the project, what needs to be done in case of disputes, what are communication standards for the team, and what is seen as acceptable behaviour with other colleages. These set of rules have been decided upon by the entire team and will be abided by completely.

**GitHub Wiki**
The team was confused as to whether the Wikis for the repository should be hosted by making the repository public instead of private. Advantages and disadvantages were presented by the team members on the motion to turn the repository visibility public. James Zhao suggested the possibility of removing the organization and working as collaboraters on the project. None of the motions have been passed or dismissed, and the motion has been added to the TODO list. In the meantime, a temporary *sample-wiki.md* page was created in the repository and introduction cards, a title, a mantra, and team values were added.

**Video**
Team members have agreed on submitting their personal introductions to Yash Shah who will concatenate the clips using iMovie. The script will include the name of the presenter, their hobby/fun fact, and something funny to say/do. The video will then be added to the Wiki page.
