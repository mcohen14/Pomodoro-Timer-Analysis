## Business from previous meeting

**Planning and Brainstorming**  
- Instead of using a timer, have an animation of a tomato growing
  - This makes the actual time more ambiguous to help keep people from getting distracted from the time
- Customizability
  - Pre-set customizability, but not changeable during the app
  - Or donâ€™t have customizability
  - Keybinds, notification sound/methods, visuals
    - Visualization? Should show/hide timer customization
    - Default configuration? 
    
**Project Pitch**
- We also began the project pitch
