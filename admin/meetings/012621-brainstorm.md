## Business from previous meeting

**Planning and Brainstorming**  
- Potential idea 1: Instead of using a timer, have an animation of a tomato growing
  - This makes it actually more difficult for people to stop getting distracted
- Potential idea 2: Customizability
  - Should users be allowed to select from a pre-defined set of timeds for their breaks betweeen of pomodoro sessions?
  - This will be pre-set customizability; not changeable during the session execution
  - Or maybe users should not be given customizability options
  - Keybinds, notification sound/methods, visuals as a potential add-on feature in later iterations of the app
    - Visualization? Should the user be given the choice of showing/hiding the timer
    - Should this be made a default configuration asked once before the start of the session and unchanging for the rest of the day?
