**Team Roles**  
Roles for each member were finalized, with each team member (except for the coordinators) receiving 2 roles - a primary role that they will effectively be incharge of, and a secondary role executed post-completion of the primary role. Each member will have an equal contribution in the planning of the web app. Designing has been assigned to Ivan Robles and Yash Shah, developing has been assigned to James Zhao and Haaris Waleh, and building and testing has been assigned to Luke. Muhammad Z Khan and Xavier will serve as team coordinators, with each supervising one half of the project while also contributing to the same.

## Agenda
Plan how the web app will look like on Miro  
Discuss on what features can be added in the long run  
Create a Minimum Viable Product(MVP) layout  
Create a flowchart for MVP

## New Business

**Planning and Brainstorming**  
All of the following prototyping and planning work can be found at [Miro for Teamato](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lXAjFME=/)

- **App with complete functionality (Final product)**  
  The app will consist of 3 tabs - the working tab, a short break tab, and a long break tab.  
  The working tab will handle the 25 minute timer, along with a list of tasks. The app will ask the user for a list of tasks that they wish to get done during that day. The app will then ask them the estimated number of pomodoro session they will require to get each task done. Once a task is done, the app will cross out the task and record the actual number of pomodoro sessions that were required.  
  There will be a *start* button to start the timer for the session and a *stop* button to reset the timer. There will be no *play* or *pause* features implemented since they go against the idea of what the app is trying to achieve.  
  The short break tab will handle short 5 minute breaks in between each pomodoro session, which is automatically started once a session is completed.  
  The long break tab will handle breaks of duration approximately 20-25 minutes which will begin once a task is completed, or if 4 pomodoro sessions have been run in succession.  
  We also plan to add APIs like voice recognition in order to enhance the app. Breaks may be accompanied by relaxing visuals and audios.

- **Minimum Viable Product (App Version #1)**
  A mockup was created for the first version of the app - the Minimum Viable product - which meets all of the basic requirements for being classified as a pomodoro app. We discussed on what features needed to be in the MVP and we decided that a start button, a stop button, a timer, and two break tabs will be implemented. As part of this, a flowchart was created which detailed what course of action the app will take given the pressing of a particular button during the execution of the app. We considered cases when users would refresh a page, stop the timer before the session was completed, or including an *end-of-day* button to reset the entire app page.
  Basic assumptions were made like the user will not refresh the page.
  

**Standup Meeting times**  
The team settled on meeting at 4:00 PM on Tuesdays.
