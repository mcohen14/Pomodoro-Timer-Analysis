# Sprint 3 Retrospective

For our retrospective, we used Retrium. Members of our team put forward what they thought went well in our Sprint 3 and what they thought could have been done better. 
We compiled all these thought to define the approach we will take for our next sprint i.e. the Last Sprint. These thoughts have been listed below.

## What went well, What could have been done better and the action plan we can take to do better

## What didn't go well & the corresponding Action Plan

#### As a team, we were sometimes struggling to unanimously agree on a decision / Still have to settle on a color scheme:
We will be creating a poll channel on our team's slack where each mamber can vote for or against a decision. The majority's vote will be followed.

#### Lack of branch organization on GitHub / Merging happened relatively late:
We will be reducing the number of branches that are cocurrently being run. Designers and Developers should make their branch, work on it, merge it to a secondary main branch, and delete their branch on a daily basis. This way there will only be two long term branches: the main branch and the secondary main branch.

#### Disagreements on Slack:
All team members should understand that constructive criticism and only constructive criticism are not only allowed but appreciated among the team. Refrain from destructive criticism but be confident when giving constructive criticism.

#### Miscommunication resulted in code conflicts:
If a member wants to change some shared branch, he must communicate it with the team. Also major changes should be refrained from. Instead, if a major change is necessary, gradually implement parts of the changes so that the other members have the opportunity to merge with the small changes without too many complications.

#### Roles could have been solidified earlier / Improper division of labor / Design not prioritized
Roles were revamped and teams were re-arranged during sprint 2 to tackle this issue. Also, an eye will be kept on whether further rearrangements are necessary and pro-active steps will be taken.
