# Integrating a Task-List in our Pomodoro Timer App

## Context and Problem Statement
Should we add a Task-list in our app?

## Considered Options

* Yes - Help user manage time and task using the same app.
* No - Keep the app as simple and to the point as possible.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: 'Yes' because,

* Implementing a Task-List may increase complexity, the complexity can be limited if we design carefully.
* Not integrating may keep our product simple, but it hinders its functionality as well.
* It may make our app more complex but it will make the overall user explerience simpler as he/she doesn't have to worry about multiple tools to manage.
* Having a task-list reinforces Pomodoro philosophy as keeping track of tasks and the number of pomodoros it took is an integral part of the Pomodoro way.
