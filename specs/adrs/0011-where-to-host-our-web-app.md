# Where will we be hosting our PomoHero Web App

## Context and Problem Statement

What service should we use to host our Pomodoro timer website

## Considered Options

* Github Pages - Use Github's built-in hosting feature
* Firebase - Use an external hosting service by Google

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: 'Firebase', because

* Firebase is free to use just like Github Pages but with additional benefits.
* It is HTTPS secure unlike Github Pages, thus it is more compatible with the industry standards and external tools.
* It can work on private github repositaries aswell unlike Github Pages.
