# Color scheme of our PomoHero Web App

## Context and Problem Statement

What should be the color scheme of our PomoHero Web App

## Considered Options

* Red & Green - This scheme matches the color of a tomato which is the main theme of Pomodoro 
* Green & Blue - This scheme promotes concentration and calm more which is the main objective of Pomodoro 

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: 'Green and Blue', because

* It does a better job of matching our main aim i.e. propogating calm, concentration and coolness.
* If our timer is used correctly, the user will be looking our UI less and focusing on the work on hand more. Thus it becomes unimportant how close our colors matched the tomato theme.
* The chosen color scheme hasn't been implemented to the MVP due to time constraint but it will be implemented in our final product.
