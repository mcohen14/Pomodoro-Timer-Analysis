# Navigation Widgets Placement

## Context and Problem Statement

Our Pomodoro Timer contains some navigation widgets such as link to instructions, button for our tasklist pop-up etc. But where on the browser should these widgets be placed? 

## Considered Options

* Somewhere in the center, near the timer. This way, it will be more accessible as it will be inside the user's view. Furthermore, if the widgets are attached near the central timer, it won't have to be changed too much when our app is viewed on screens of varying dimensions.
* Somewhere in the corner. This way, the navigation viewer will not be always in user's view. This may reduce accessibility but also reduce distraction as the user's eye will have less objects to see on the screen, thus letting him focus on his own work. 

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: 'Somewhere in the corner', because

* The other options compromise on the Pomodoro philosophy. The pomodoro philosophy focuses more on focus and productivity and not accessibility.
* Furthermore, if the user is using our timer correctly, the amount of time that the user needs to access the navigation widgets will be minimal as we try to keep everything automated.
