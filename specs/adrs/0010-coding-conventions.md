## Context and Problem Statement

Multiple people from our team will be developing the code for our Pomodoro Timer. To ensure that every developer's code is consistent to each other, we put some conventions in place which should be followed by all coders on our team.

## Chosen Conventions

* Variables should have meaningful names.
* Variable names should not be less then 3 letters.
* 4 spaces must be used for indentation.
* A line code should not exceed 100 characters. 
* Global variables i.e. variables starting with ```var``` must not be used.
* Snake-case must be used when naming variables.
* Camel-case must be used when naming functions.
* The first letter should represent what datatype the variable is. For instance, if the variable contains a number, it should be named ```n_varname```. The following convention must be used:
  - ```n_``` for numbers
  - ```b_``` for booleans
  - ```s_``` for strings
  - ```o_``` for objects
  - ```a_``` for arrays
  - ```f_``` for functions
* For commenting, code-blocking should be used as much as possible.
