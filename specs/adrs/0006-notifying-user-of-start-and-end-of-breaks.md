# Notifying Users of Start/End of Breaks

## Context and Problem Statement

How should we notify user about taking a break or get back to work?

## Considered Options

* Notification - A notification pop-up
* Audio Cue - Play a ring to notify user

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: 'Both Option 1 and 2' because,

* Option 1 is a good visual cue incase the user has his PC sound turned off.
* Option 2 is a good audible cue incase the user is submerged in his work and not scanning his PC screen.
