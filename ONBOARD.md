## Commenting with JSDocs

You can check out the JavaScript documentations [here](https://yitianwang18.github.io/cse112-s22-group14/).

We use JSDocs to automatically generate code level documentations.
Comments specifically for JavaScript code should be uniquely formatted in a way that can be interpreted by JSDoc.
