# Customizing Number of Pomos in Settings

## Context and Problem Statement

* We are considering adding the option to allow the user to change the number of pomos in a session. The default setting is to require the user work for three full pomos before the long break

## Considered Options

* Allow the user to choose between 2-4 pomos before the long break
* Do not allow the user to choose number of pomos, only have standard of 3 pomos before long break

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Do not allow the user to choose number of pomos

* We want to stay fairly true to the original pomodoro technique, which is why we decided to only allow three choices for all of the customization options
* We felt that if the user could change the number of pomos in a session, it breaks too much of the pattern the pomodoro technique is trying to create, which reduces its effectiveness
