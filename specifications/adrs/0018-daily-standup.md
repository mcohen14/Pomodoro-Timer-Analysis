# Daily Standup Procedure

## Context and Problem Statement

We are required to do daily standup to keep track of each team members progress throughout the weeks.

## Considered Options

* 12pm on slack - Use Alice bot to automate standup processes. Report standups through Alice to slack's stand-ups channel.
  * report daily standups by 12pm PDT.

  * Report from Monday to Friday.

## Decision Outcome

* Choose "12pm on slack" because it is the easiest way to do due to everyone's schedule being different.
Pick 12pm because most people got up by 12pm.
