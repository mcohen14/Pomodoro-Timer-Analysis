# Deciding on a new app name

## Context and Problem Statements

* Since we create a new web app on firebase, we cannot reuse the previous hostname for the web app. Therefore, we need to decide on a new app name that can also be used as the hostname of the web app.

## Considered Options

* Powelldoro
* Calm-odoro
* Palm-odoro
* Pomodowell

## Decision Outcomes

We finalized on Powelldoro because

* Powelldoro and Palm-odoro has the highest vote
* Palm-odoro infers a theme of palm trees. We don't like some of the palm tree backgrounds we found online and many are hard to use for dealing with responsiveness in the web app (e.g. Resizing the window).
* Powelldoro is playful, and fit with the context of this class.
* An interesting name with some backstory can attract more users.
