# Finalizing the Direction For Our Second Theme

## Context and Problem Statement

* Currently, we have a temporary black background for our second theme. We do not want to keep this as plain black because it seems lazy and is inconsistent with our primary theme having an image.

## Considered Options

* Bright Image - Our primary forest theme is already fairly dark, so maybe we want to have a brighter alternative in case some of our users would prefer that
* Black / Super Dark Image - This would take the dark aspect of the dark theme very literally and find a background image that fits the primary purpose of this theme to be a dark mode
* Dark Blue Image - Blue has psychologically been associated with calmness and concentration, so we might want to have a blue background. While the primary purpose of this theme would now be to facilitate calmness and concentration, we would still want it to be a dark image to still be a darker theme

## Decision Outcomes

We decided on the Dark Blue Image:
    * Mainly for the psychological benefits
    * We brainstormed some ideas for the image to be the ocean or the night sky
    * We will try to find good images before Wednesday's meeting and finalize then
