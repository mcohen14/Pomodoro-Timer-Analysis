# Are We Going to Create a Visual Timer?

## Context and Problem Statement

* We initially considered creating some kind of visual to accompany our timer when we were intially deciding what tasks to prioritize for the entire project. After last week's set of presentations, we saw that the majority of other groups that were doing Pomodoro timers had implemented a visual timer as well. We need to decide if we are going to implement one or not

## Considered Options

* Implement a Larger, Cool Visual Timer - This would likely the most effective visual timer from a user's perspective because they would actually be able to use it as an alternative to the text timer
* Implement a Smaller, Subtler Visual Timer - This would be the most consistent with our values of simplicity and limiting distractions, but it might not be all that useful for a user if it is small and the text timer is right there
* No Visual Timer - This might be the most logical depending on how useful we think a small visual timer is

## Decision Outcomes

We chose to not implement a visual timer because: 
    * We did not want to create a large, flashy visual timer because it contradicted our values way too much
    * We could not create much of a rationale for a smaller visual timer because we did not think it would be too useful for a user because if it is closely coupled with the text timer and is not flashy enough to attract that much attention, the user would just default to the text timer
