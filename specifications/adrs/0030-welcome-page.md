# Should the Initial Popup Be Instructions or a New Welcome Page?

## Context and Problem Statement

* Right now, when the user has not visited the website ever or in the last 30 days, the instructions page automatically opens up. After some end user testing, we have found that the instructions page is a bit confusing and overwhelming for new users with no idea what the project is about

## Considered Options

* Keep Instructions as Initial Popup: Requires no additional work (given it's Week 10), but compromises UX
* Add Welcome Page: Significantly improves UX and it is not that much work

## Decision Outcome

We chose to add the welcome page because:
  * We decided the boost to UX was too high to not implement the feature
  * Doesn't take that long to create, especially since the popup code already exists
