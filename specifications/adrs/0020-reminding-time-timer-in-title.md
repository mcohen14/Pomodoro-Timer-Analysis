# Remind users the remaining time in the current session

## Contexts and Problems Statement

Users want to check session time. We want to help user focus and stay on their tasks.

## Considered Options

* Do nothing - if users want to see the time, they need to go the web page
* Timer in title - Use the title to reflect remaining time.

## Decision Outcomes

We choose Timer in title, because

* User will want to take a quick peek at the timer while working in other websites.
* Having a clock on the title is not that distracting.
