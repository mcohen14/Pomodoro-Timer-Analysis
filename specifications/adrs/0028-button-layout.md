# Do We Want to Change Our Button Layout?

## Context and Problem Statement

* Currently, all four of our buttons (change theme, open task list, open settings, and open instructions) are all grouped up at the top left of our website.  We received feedback from Frenemies and Professor Powell to put the change theme button inside the Settings menu, so we will be doing that. But Professor Powell also suggested an alternative layout for the buttons, so we need to decide if this layout is something we want to keep.

## Considered Options

* Professor Powell's idea of splitting up the buttons: Powell suggested that we keep the task list button at the top right because it is by far the most important of the three remaining buttons so it should be the focus. Afterwards, he suggested putting the information button in the bottom left and the settings button in the bottom right because they are not that important. Potential downside is that this makes the screen a bit messier and might be confusing for users
* Keep layout as is: This layout keeps all of the buttons in the same spot, next to each other, so that will not be confusing for users. The downside is that it is a bit harder to tell that the task list button is more important than the others

## Decision Outcome

We chose to keep the button layout as is because:
  * We thought it would be too confusing and messy for users if there were buttons in all three corners of the screen
  * We are trying to emphasize the importance of the tasklist button by having it be the first button in the row, rather than the second like it was previously
