# Meet the Redeem Team

## Introduction

The Redeem Team was formed to complete our CSE 112 project at UCSD, which was to take a project a team member had previously worked on in CSE 110 and improve it to make it a 1.0, deployment-ready product that was up to industry standards. Each of us felt that there were many improvements we could make following our experience working on our CSE 110 project, and we were ready to redeem ourselves. We set our goal to be to work efficiently and effectively as a team to create a user-focused, well-tested, and polished 1.0 application.

- Position: Developer
- Hi, my name is Justin, and I am a Computer Science major at UCSD in Warren College, graduating in Spring 2023. After just taking CSE 110 the quarter before, this was a breath of fresh air, as I found more freedom to create features, and felt more realistic to how software engineering jobs should be like. Through the lectures and my time spent working on this project, I have learned a lot of good practices and cherished useful experiences that I can't wait to apply to the software engineering industry when my time comes. 

### Ivan Robles

- Position: UI/UX Designer
- Hi, my name is Ivan Alejandro Robles Alvarez. I am a computer engineering major graduating from UCSD in June 2022. I'm an artist at heart; I love drawing, designing, and creating works of art, which includes software. I'm also passionate about helping others, which includes making things that everyone can use and enjoy, no matter their background or accessibility issues. These two traits are what motivate me to become the best front-end software engineer possible, always taking into consideration the effects of my software and not just churn out code.
