# Meet the Redeem Team

## Introduction

The Redeem Team was formed to complete our CSE 112 project at UCSD, which was to take a project a team member had previously worked on in CSE 110 and improve it to make it a 1.0, deployment-ready product that was up to industry standards. Each of us felt that there were many improvements we could make following our experience working on our CSE 110 project, and we were ready to redeem ourselves. We set our goal to be to work efficiently and effectively as a team to create a user-focused, well-tested, and polished 1.0 application.
