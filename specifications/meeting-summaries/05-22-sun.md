# Redeem Team - Sunday Meeting, May 22nd

## Group Discussion / Votes
- Task List Color: Olive Green for Forest Theme
- Second Theme:
  - Want background image, instead of plain black
  - Dark Blue - Calming color
  - Must be resizable, not flashy
  - Ideas: Ocean, Night Sky 
- Safari Notification: How many times to show it?
  - Keep showing until they check "Do Not Show Me This Again"
- Visual Timer:
  - Lots of other groups did it
  - Not that beneficial for UX
  - Could potentially detract from values of simplicity and limiting distractions

## Sprint #3 Retrospective
- Rishmal:
  - Wrote documentation: last week of standups, copied over all meeting summaries
  - Adjusted some Cypress tests to pass for existing code
  - Will do linting once `dev` is up to date
- Ivan:
  - Created UI for settings tab, but it is not fully responsive to mobile
  - Not fully finished with drag and drop since drag and drop is not fully done
- Justin and Matt:
  - Fixed mobile and Safari, needed touch events and boudn the handlers to the div, instead of the tasks
- Evan and Bill: 
  - Mostly finished, but ht eclicked state of the button is not updated on the settings menu
  - Will finish that and testing this sprint
- Jenny:
  - Got notification to popup, will work on a "Do Not Show Me This Again" checkbox
