# Redeem Team - Wednesday Meeting, May 25th

## Frenemy Discussion
- Explained Frenemy tasks: We need to receive an End User Review and a Peer Developer Review from one group and provide an End User Review and a Peer Developer Review for another group
- Rishmal and Tony have volunteered to receive the two reviews and take notes on the sessions
- Justin volunteered to provide the End User Review
- Asked for volunteers to provide the Peer Developer Review, but no one volunteered so Rishmal or Tony will do it
