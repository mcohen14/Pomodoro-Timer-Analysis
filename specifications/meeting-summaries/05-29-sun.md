# Redeem Team - Sunday Meeting, May 29th

# Frenemy Reviews
- End User Feedback
  - We have already pushed changes to reflect the suggestions made about error messages, settings, task list, and spelling errors
  - Suggested Changes:
    - Reset to Default Button in Settings
    - Tabbing in Settings
    - Images in Information Tab
    - Choices in Notifications Sound Options
    - Suggestions for Number of Pomos
- Peer Developer Feedback
  - Received good feedback regarding our GitHub Actions, testing, CI/CD pipeline, overall UI, hotkeys, and source code 
  - Brought up issue that we have discussed at length: How does user know to click on Task List button?
    - Recommended a good solution: add the image for the task list button to the Information tab
  - For accessibility, recommended that we check HTML validation because it adds a lot to accesibility
  - Source code still has a lot of div-itis from previous group
  - Event Bus model and general source code all makes sense and all has a purpose
  - Main CSS file is really long
