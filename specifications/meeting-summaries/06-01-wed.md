# Redeem Team - Wednesday Meeting, June 1st

## Suggested Changes from Powell's Office Hours
- UI
  - Change background color of Instructions (and all menus) on stars theme to be a bit brighter -> Increase contrast
  - Add more space between title and subtitle
  - Left align subtitles
  - Remove next task from showing during session because it will take away from user's focus
  - Remove reset button because it is not consistent with the original Pomodoro technique
  - Delete note in settings because it suggests that something is broken
  - Redesign buttons because tasklist is much more important than others
    - Separate buttons to three corners and put theme button in settings
- Accessibility
  - Improve tabbing on main page
    - Remove buttons on logo and banner
    - Style focus ring
- Testing
  - Primary features should be close to 100%
  - Others should ideally be at least 75%

## Updates We've Decided to Make
- Improve contrast for background color of menus on stars theme 
- Improve styling on Instructions:
  - Space between title and first subtitle (maybe between all subsections?)
  - Left align subtitles
- Remove next task from showing during session
- Remove the reset button. Convert Start and End buttons to one button that switches text and functionality based on if a session is active or not
- Delete note in settings
- Move theme button to settings
- Add style focus rings
- Add testing
  
## Miscellaneous
- We will record our video during our usual meeting time next Wed
  - We will have the slides / demo idea mostly settled by then
