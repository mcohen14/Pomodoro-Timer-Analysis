# Road Map for PomoHero (by Teamato) 

## Sprint 1 - All Decisions leading up to the MVP: 

### Design Docs

- ADRs: 
  - Major decisions should be finalized and logged in specs/adrs/ 
  - Don't give room for too many minor changes after finalization
    - Minor changes (non-groundbreaking decisions) can be pushed to future sprints

- System Design: 
  - Finish C4 Diagrams (Haaris) 

- User Thinking: 
  - Flesh out all User personas and then construct User Profiles (Team)

- Wireframing: (Ivan)
  - Finalize low fidelity wireframes
  - High fidelity wireframes are a bonus

-  Agile Proces:
   -  Planning / Meeting notes
