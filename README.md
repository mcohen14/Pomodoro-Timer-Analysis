If you are looking for a place where you can organize your work, better concentrate, and get actual work done, you are at the right place!

With the power of the Pomodoro, you are in for a nice and long focussed session of study.

Make sure you are all alone, phones put away, social networking sites' notifications turned off, a *Do not Disturb* sign hung on your door, and you are all set :)

## About Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro technique is a scientifically proven way to help increase productivity. Ultimately, people are more productive by taking small mental breaks. Powelldoro automates the process for you, making it easier for you to reduce distractions and focus on your work.

## Instruction

### Add Tasks for the Session

* Click on the task list button and add all tasks you want to do
